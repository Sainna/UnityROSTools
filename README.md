# ROS Tools for Unity
Welcome to my ROS Tools package for Unity. Its aim is to provide a way to reduce boilerplate code such as service/publisher registration and allow for easy use of Unity's ROS capabilities using a GUI.
This project is a work in progress and should be considered as unstable. Currently, only services are supported in a very early fashion. 

## How to install

In the Unity Package manager, add a package from git URL and use the following:
```
https://github.com/Sainna/UnityROSTools.git
```

## Documentation
Documentation is a work in progress. You can access it here: [https://sainna.github.io/UnityROSTools](https://sainna.github.io/UnityROSTools)
